# Python Grinder

This repository contains my personal journey of learning Python — notes, examples, experiments, and anything I find useful along the way.
Nothing fancy, nothing overengineered — just a growing collection of code that helps me understand Python better.

## What’s inside

- Small scripts and practice exercises
- Notes and explanations in plain language
- Experiments with different Python features
- Anything I want to test, break, or rewrite later

Basically: a playground.

## Goals

- Learn Python step by step
- Build intuition, not just memorize syntax
- Keep track of what I’ve learned
- Make it easy to revisit concepts later

## Why I made this

Because learning is messy. This repo helps me:

- Stay consistent
- Document my progress
- Store useful examples
- Avoid forgetting what I already learned

## Notes

This repo will grow naturally. Structure may change whenever I feel like reorganizing things.
It’s a living workspace — not a polished product.
