# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering a contribution!
To keep things simple and smooth, please follow these rules:

1. **Open an issue first**: If you want to add something new or change existing content, create an issue to discuss it.

2. **Use clear commits**: Write short, meaningful commit messages that explain what you changed.

3. **Keep pull requests small**: Focus on one topic per PR. Small changes are easier to review and merge.

4. **Follow the project style**: Keep your code, structure, and formatting consistent with the rest of the repo.

5. **Be respectful during discussions**: No drama, no ego. Keep feedback constructive and focused on improvement.

6. **Test your changes**: Make sure your code runs without errors before submitting a PR.
