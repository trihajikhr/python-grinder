# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue, please report it privately by opening a *private issue* or contacting me directly. Do **not** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed.

## Scope
This project is for learning, but security concerns are still taken seriously. Any issues related to code execution, unsafe input handling, or dependency risks are welcome.

## Response
I will review reports as soon as possible and provide a fix or mitigation when necessary.
